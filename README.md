This is a website of a company and how it interface should look, I was inspired to make this out of creative as the structure and designs are very user-friendly with cool animations. This project is made with HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript code....want to learn how I did the cool animations..follow my IG, I will be releasing a tutorial soon
